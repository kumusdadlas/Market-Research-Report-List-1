<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical Dialysis Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Peritoneal Dialysis</li><li>Hemodialysis</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The medical dialysis devices market is primarily divided into two types: peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis. Peritoneal dialysis involves infusing a sterile solution into the abdominal cavity to remove waste and excess fluid, allowing for flexibility and home treatment options. Hemodialysis, on the other hand, uses an external machine to filter blood through a dialyzer, typically requiring clinic visits several times a week. Both methods aim to replace kidney function in patients with renal failure, catering to varying patient needs and preferences.</p></p>
